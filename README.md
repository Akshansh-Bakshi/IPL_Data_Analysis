# IPL_Data_Analysis
The following is a project made through Python and its library. It focuses on the 2025 data analysis of the IPL season 

The project focused on the 2025 IPL season only. Made using libraries like Streamlit, Plotly.Express, Pandas, RegEx, and Numpy. 

1. Streamlit was used for the basic make of the web application
2. Plotly.Express was used to make all the dynamic and visual graphs. The library was used over Matplotlib because of its better features in presenting things.
3. Pandas were basically used for data cleaning and processing. All the data used in this project was acquired from Kaggle.
4. Numpy and RegEx were the basics were data transformation and handling. A lot of things need to change while acquiring data from Kaggle so this was the right tool for it.

Talking about the project, this basically focuses on data analysis (I know I have written this too many times now). How it will do it, let's talk about that. We have got sections
