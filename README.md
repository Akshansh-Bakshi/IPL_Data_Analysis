# IPL_Data_Analysis
The following is a project made through Python and its library. It focuses on the 2025 data analysis of the IPL season 

The project focused on the 2025 IPL season only. Made using libraries like Streamlit, Plotly.Express, Pandas, RegEx, and Numpy. 

1. Streamlit was used for the basic make of the web application
2. Plotly.Express was used to make all the dynamic and visual graphs. The library was used over Matplotlib because of its better features in presenting things.
3. Pandas were basically used for data cleaning and processing. All the data used in this project was acquired from Kaggle.
4. Numpy and RegEx were the basics were data transformation and handling. A lot of things need to change while acquiring data from Kaggle, so this was the right tool for it.

Talking about the project, this basically focuses on data analysis (I know I have written this too many times now). How it will do it, let's talk about that. We have sections in the project. Starting from player analysis to team analysis. We took data from Kaggle for most runs scored, most wickets taken, and many more things like that. Then we used Plotly all over it to visualize it. We made different dashboards for batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders to make it a bit more exciting and a visual treat. Talking about the team analysis, we went over statistics like games won, auction money spent and about all the players and thier stats for the team.

As a future aspect, we would love to add pitch and venue analysis, along with some ML applications to make it more dynamic and future ready.
